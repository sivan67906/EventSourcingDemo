## üéØ Hands-On Exercises

After understanding the basics, try these exercises:

### Exercise 1: Add a New Event
Add support for transferring money between accounts.

**Steps:**
1. Create `MoneyTransferred` event
2. Add `Transfer()` method to BankAccount
3. Update the Apply method
4. Test in Program.cs

**Solution hints:**
```csharp
public class MoneyTransferred : DomainEvent
{
    public Guid FromAccountId { get; init; }
    public Guid ToAccountId { get; init; }
    public decimal Amount { get; init; }
}
```

### Exercise 2: Add a Business Rule
Prevent withdrawals that would take the balance below $100 (minimum balance).

**Steps:**
1. Modify the Withdraw method validation
2. Add test cases
3. Run and verify

### Exercise 3: Create a New Projection
Create a "Transaction History" projection that shows all transactions for an account.

**Steps:**
1. Create `TransactionHistory` class
2. Handle events (MoneyDeposited, MoneyWithdrawn)
3. Build from events
4. Display in Program.cs

### Exercise 4: Add Snapshots
Implement snapshots to improve performance for accounts with many events.

**Steps:**
1. Create `AccountSnapshot` class
2. Implement snapshot storage
3. Modify loading logic to use snapshots
4. Test with 1000+ events

### Exercise 5: Event Versioning
Modify the `MoneyDeposited` event to include a currency field.

**Steps:**
1. Create `MoneyDepositedV2` with Currency field
2. Handle both old and new versions in Apply method
3. Test event replay with mixed versions

### Key Files to Understand

**Must Read:**
- `Events.cs` - Foundation of the pattern
- `BankAccount.cs` - Heart of the aggregate
- `EventStore.cs` - Event persistence
- `Program.cs` - See it in action

**Important:**
- `BankAccountRepository.cs` - Loading/saving
- `AccountSummaryProjection.cs` - Read models
- `README.md` - Concepts explained

**Reference:**
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - When coding
- `DIAGRAMS.md` - When confused

## üí° Common Questions

### Q: How long does it take to learn?
**A:** 
- Basic understanding: 2-3 hours (read + run demo)
- Comfortable coding: 1-2 days (with exercises)
- Production ready: 1-2 weeks (with real project)

### Q: Is this production-ready code?
**A:** 
This is educational code. For production:
- Use real database (SQL Server, EventStoreDB, PostgreSQL)
- Add error handling
- Implement proper concurrency
- Add monitoring and logging
- Consider snapshots
- Add event versioning strategy

### Q: Can I use this code in my project?
**A:** 
Yes! But adapt it:
- Replace InMemoryEventStore with real database
- Add your domain events
- Implement your business rules
- Add authentication/authorization
- Add proper error handling

### Q: What's the next step after this demo?
**A:**
1. **Learn CQRS** - Pairs well with Event Sourcing
2. **Study Domain-Driven Design** - Provides context
3. **Build a real project** - Best way to learn
4. **Read production implementations** - See real patterns

### Q: Do I need to use Event Sourcing everywhere?
**A:** 
**No!** Use selectively:
- Event Sourcing for: Core business entities with complex rules
- Traditional for: Simple CRUD, lookups, configuration

### Q: What about performance?
**A:**
- **Writes**: Fast (append-only)
- **Reads**: Use projections (as fast as traditional)
- **Many events**: Use snapshots
- **Scale**: Event stores scale horizontally
